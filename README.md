# visual-basic
A few old Visual Basic things I did

Note that these required VB5 runtimes, but you're on your own for finding and installing that! (it's actually still available on Microsoft's download site, but you can dig it out yourself).

* **javascript-class-generator** - a JavaScript class generator that seemed like a good idea the time (ugh).
  
* **programmers-ascii-reference** - an ASCII reference app I put together because I needed it while working on some project I can't remember now something like 20+ years ago
